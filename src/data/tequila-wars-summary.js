    TEQUILA FACTS. CONSULT THIS FIRST!
    =================================

    Where is tequila made?
    Only five States of Mexico can produce tequila: Jalisco, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas. Before 1978, tequila was unregulated worldwide. In 1978, leading companies established a globally-recognized Denomination of Origin (D.O.) ensuring the entire production process occurs within the defined region. Other D.O.-protected products include Parmigiano Reggiano and Champagne. Tequila was the first Mexican food or beverage with a D.O.

    What are the rules and classifications of tequila?
    Tequila must be made from blue Weber agave grown in one of the five designated states. The D.O. certifies both the agave and production come from these regions, tying the spirit's identity to its terroir.
    There are two types: 100% Agave Tequila (all sugar from blue Weber agave) and Tequila/Mixtos (minimum 51% agave sugars, the rest from grain, corn, or cane).
    Aging classifications:
    - Blanco (Silver/Plata): unaged or rested up to two months in pipones.
    - Reposado: aged two months to one year.
    - Añejo: aged one to three years.
    - Extra Añejo: aged minimum three years.
    - Cristalino: aged tequila filtered to appear transparent.

    How is tequila made?
    Once blue Weber agave plants reach maturity (up to 12 years) with enough sugar content (Brix), Jimadores harvest the piña by cutting off leaves with a razor-sharp blade. Piñas are cooked to convert carbohydrates into fermentable sugars — traditionally in brick ovens (hornos), or with modern diffusers and autoclaves using steam and pressure, which reduces time, water and energy.
    The cooked agave sugar (aguamiel) is extracted via roller mill or stone tahona wheel, then distilled. Cuervo and 1800 Tequila use both copper pot stills and column stills, and only new American or French oak barrels for aging. Premium expressions are finished in Cognac, Sherry, Single Malt, or Port casks.
    After distillation, blanco rests up to two months, reposado ages 2-12 months, añejo 1-3 years, and extra añejo 3+ years.

    What is agave?
    A succulent native to Mexico with tall, spiny leaves protecting the piña. Often mistaken for a cactus, it's actually closer to the lily family (Liliaceae). It's a century plant — it blooms only once in its lifetime.

    Who is Jose Cuervo and who invented tequila?
    Jose Antonio de Cuervo founded the family business in 1758, obtaining land from the King of Spain and naming it Solar de las Animas. In 1795, his son Jose María Guadalupe de Cuervo received the first official charter to produce tequila commercially, selling the first Vino Mezcal de Tequila de Jose Cuervo.
    Today, Jose Cuervo is the oldest tequila company in the world — an 11th generation, family-owned Mexican company still run by the same family. They were the first to farm agave for tequila production and the first to perform intensive cultivation.

    What is La Rojeña?
    The oldest active tequila distillery in Latin America and the oldest distillery in the Americas, built in 1812 by Cuervo Tequila. Still operating in the town of Tequila, Jalisco.

    What is the NOM?
    The Norma Oficial Mexicana (NOM) is an administrative entity connected to a tequila producer. Jose Cuervo has NOM 1122, encompassing all four distilleries (La Rojeña 1, La Rojeña 2, 1800, Los Camichines) and five brands (Cuervo, Reserva de la Familia, Gran Centenario, 1800, Maestro Dobel, Gran Coramino).

    What is the CRT?
    The Consejo Regulador del Tequila is the official regulatory body overseeing tequila production. It certifies compliance with NOMs, approves every barrel made, and conducts inspections worldwide. It's a non-profit with all distilleries as equal members.

    What is a diffuser?
    A machine using hot water and steam to pressure wash shredded agave fibers, extracting sugary liquid that's then cooked via steam. Diffusers reduce water usage by 50%, energy by 46%, and agave by 20%. They create a different flavor profile and are a more sustainable production method.

    Is tequila made sustainably?
    Cuervo has invested in stillage treatment plants processing about 2 million liters per day. 1800 Tequila reuses, recycles, and repurposes 100% of the agave plant as compost, and supports growers with industry-leading wages and long-term contracts.

    What about additives in tequila?
    Tequila is allowed up to 1% additives in 100% agave tequila. Common additives (used across all spirits, including wine, Rum, Vodka, Cognac, Scotch): caramel extract for color, oak extract for flavor, glycerin for mouthfeel, and sweeteners. These are not unhealthy — they create consistency and standardization.
    Any aged tequila touching a barrel may contain compounds imparted from the wood or previous spirit. "Additive-free" is not an official category — there's no regulatory certification or standardized lab test. Third-party organizations offering "additive-free" labels lack infrastructure for regular batch testing. The moment a spirit touches a barrel, calling it additive-free is misleading.

    What barrels age tequila?
    New American or French oak, or used barrels like American Bourbon. Some expressions are finished in Cognac, Sherry, or Port casks. Cuervo Tradicional Añejo is aged in new American oak then finished in Bushmills Irish single malt whiskey barrels. Reserva de la Familia Extra Añejo is aged in new American and French oak, blended with older reserves from the family cellars.

    =================================

    CUERVO PRODUCTION DETAILS (from Master Distiller)

    Cuervo Firsts: First tequila producers. First to farm agave at scale. First to use masonry brick ovens. First to introduce glass bottles, mechanical mills, and electricity to tequila-making. Today, Cuervo plants more agaves than any other company worldwide.

    Production Methods by Product:
    - Masonry brick ovens (hornos): Used for Tradicional, Reserva de la Familia, and premium expressions. Slow-roasted 36-40 hours.
    - Diffusers: Used for Cuervo Especial, Cuervo Authentics, and Cuervo RTDs. More sustainable — 50% less water, 46% less energy, 20% less agave.
    - Cuervo does NOT use acid thermal hydrolysis. The diffuser works at atmospheric pressure using only hot water and steam. The extracted juice is boiled (thermal hydrolysis) to convert starches to fermentable sugars.

    Cuervo Especial (Gold & Silver):
    - 51% Blue Weber agave + 49% sugars from grain or cane. The sugars ferment together before distilling — they are NOT cold-blending distilled alcohols together (which is illegal for tequila).
    - Especial Silver has NO additives. Especial Gold uses caramel extract for color consistency batch to batch.
    - It's the #1 selling tequila in the world.

    Agave Yield: 6.5 kilos of agave per 750ml bottle of 100% agave tequila. 3 kilos for mixto. An average mature piña weighs 36-45 kilos, yielding roughly 4-8 bottles.

    Fermentation: Closed stainless steel tanks with proprietary yeast strains, 50-60 hours. Cuervo has never used clay pots.

    Barrel Aging: Only virgin (new) oak barrels. Three toast/char levels (light, medium, heavy) determine flavor profile. The moment a tequila touches a barrel, it absorbs compounds from the charred wood or the previous liquid in the cask.

    Cuervo brands: 8 tequila brands with ~20 SKUs total. Also produces mezcals 400 Conejos and Creyente in Oaxaca. Mexican Tequila NORM forbids making other spirits in a tequila distillery.

    La Rojeña receives 200-300 tons of agave daily.

    Jimadores use custom-made coas (harvesting tools), often passed down through families. No machine can harvest agave — jimadores assess maturity, sugar content, and timing by touch and sight.

    Agave is NOT a cactus — it's more closely related to asparagus and the lily family.

    Common Misconceptions:
    - "Additive-free" labels: No regulated testing exists. Third-party distillers often make 30-40 tequilas in the same equipment, so trace additives may be present from cross-contamination in pipes, tanks, and bottling lines. All Cuervo blancos/silvers have no additives. Aged tequilas may include regulated additives (caramel extract, oak extract, glycerin) — same techniques used in whiskey, cognac, rum, and vodka for decades.
    - Tequila doesn't prevent hangovers. Any spirit in excess causes one.
    - Storing tequila in the freezer mutes aromas and flavors. Not recommended.

    Product Recommendations:
    - Whiskey drinkers: Try Tradicional Añejo (finished in Bushmills Irish whiskey barrels).
    - Blanco lovers: Reserva de la Familia Platino.
    - Complex sipping: Reserva de la Familia Reposado (three different barrel types with different toast/char levels).
    - Cocktails: Blanco for margaritas (agave-forward). Reposado or Añejo for an Old Fashioned (oak aging makes it a perfect whiskey substitute).

    =================================

    MASTER DISTILLER Q&A (Alex, Cuervo Master Distiller)

    On the additive debate (technical perspective):
    Multiple compounds considered additives are generated naturally during tequila production (Glycerol, Vanillin, 5-methylfurfural, etc.) as well as when the liquid is matured in casks (Glucose, Sucrose, Fructose, vanillin, lactones). There are also "abocantes" — additives permitted under regulations, including caramel extract for color standardization (not flavor), oak extract for flavor consistency, and glycerin for mouthfeel. Analytically in lab tests, all these compounds show up whether intentionally added or not. Because there is no regulated test in place for each distillery batch-to-batch, the additive-free conversation is misleading — it puts the responsibility on the consumer to solely trust a producer's claims. We have seen tequilas claiming additive-free that show additives in tests. All Cuervo blanco/silver tequilas do not have additives, including Especial Silver. We do use abocantes for some aged tequilas — like caramel extract in Especial Gold to standardize color batch to batch. They aren't harmful and we use them within the regulated limit defined by the CRT.

    On transparency:
    The problem is there's no official regulated testing at each distillery, which would need to be done through the CRT. Many brands claiming additive-free rely on third-party distillers making 30-40 different tequilas in the same equipment — trace additives may be present from cross-contamination in pipes, storage tanks, and bottling lines. Even with thorough cleaning every batch change, cross-contamination is always possible, making "additive-free" labeling misleading. Quality isn't determined by additive use — it's about the entire production process. In Germany, you must disclose caramel color on the bottle (and we do on Especial Gold there). In the U.S., spirits brands are not required to.

    On blanco vs reposado vs añejo:
    Blanco is unaged (can be mellowed in oak for less than 2 months). Full of agave character: bright, crisp, sometimes peppery. Perfect for margaritas.
    Reposado rests in oak for at least 2 months. Adds warmth, subtle oak notes, vanilla, light spice, smoother mouthfeel. Good for Old Fashioneds.
    Añejo ages 1-3 years in oak barrels (max 600 liters). Rich vanilla, caramel, sometimes nutty notes. The agave mellows while wood imparts complexity.
    Extra Añejo ages minimum 3 years. Deep notes of toasted almonds, vanilla, cinnamon. Meant to be sipped neat like cognac or whiskey.
    Cristalino isn't an official CRT category but has become a distinct market segment. Aged like reposado or añejo, then filtered to remove color while maintaining barrel complexity. You get aged smoothness but it's clear like a blanco.
    The type of barrel, char level, and previous use all significantly contribute to final flavor. We use everything from new American oak to wine casks to whiskey barrels depending on the product.

    On the tequila-making process:
    Precision starts in the fields. Jimadores use traditional coas to harvest at exactly the right moment. After harvesting: cooking, milling, fermenting, distilling — but there are many variable combinations. Cooking length, temperature, yeast strains, distillation pressure. For cooking, we use traditional masonry brick ovens for most premium brands, slowly roasting piñas for 36-40 hours. We also use diffusers for Especial and ready-to-serve brands — an efficient way to extract maximum sugar content. Then fermentation for 40-50 hours with proprietary yeast strains, followed by double distillation in copper pot stills or column stills depending on the product.

    On Especial vs Tradicional:
    Tradicional is our original 100% Blue Weber agave tequila, made in a very similar way for over 200 years. Features an unaged blanco plus aged variants (reposado, añejo, cristalino). Especial is 51% Blue Weber agave + 49% sugars from grain or cane, designed for accessibility, price point, and cocktails. When people buy Cuervo, they're supporting Mexican heritage — we're still Mexican family-owned and the company that invented tequila.

    On diffusers:
    Diffusers are NOT bad. They're a different tool in our arsenal as tequila production modernized. A diffuser washes shredded raw agave with hot water and steam to extract sugars. The juice is then boiled to convert starches to fermentable sugars. This differs from traditional ovens where piñas are slow-roasted first. The resulting tequila has a lighter, more herbal profile compared to oven-cooked agave. Traditional methods cook first then extract; diffusers extract first then cook. Both achieve the same goal in different sequences.

    On new tequila companies:
    The biggest challenge is that instead of competing in the technical arena, there is a lot of discrediting happening. Newer brands with little knowledge of the complexities of our industry try to tear down others to grow their own brands, rather than competing on quality and craftsmanship. There are brands releasing $300 bottles without understanding what it takes to be a tequila producer for over 200 years. They lack the legacy, agricultural knowledge and deep relationships with farmers that honest and ethical production requires. Most new brands don't plant a single agave themselves. The real work is in agave supply chain management, understanding the growing cycle, and building sustainable and equitable relationships with farmers.

    On price differences ($30 vs $200 añejo):
    Main differences come down to aging time, barrel selection, and batch size. A $30 añejo might be aged the minimum one year in standard American oak. A $200 añejo could be aged 2-3 years in specially selected barrels, maybe finished in wine or cognac casks. Age of barrels matters — we use only virgin oak, which is more expensive than used barrels. Brand recognition, sustainability standards, and premium packaging also impact price. Sometimes a fancy high-price bottle is focused more on image than quality.

    On sustainability challenges:
    The future of tequila relies on sustainable production — water conservation, agave farming practices, waste management. We're one of the few tequila producers with on-site stillage treatment facilities processing millions of liters of waste water daily, preventing pollution of surrounding waterways. We lead in sustainable farming practices and ensure fair wages for our farmers, setting above-market prices with third-party growers. There are fewer family-owned tequila companies now than even a few decades ago.

    On quality control and consistency:
    Quality control happens at multiple stages: incoming agave inspection, fermentation monitoring, distillation cuts, and final bottling. Consistency comes from controlling every variable: agave selection, yeast, fermentation temperature, distillation cuts, aging environment. We rarely dispose of batches — rejected liquid is caught and reprocessed before bottling. If something is off in a matured tequila, we can redistill it back to silver and try again, or blend it into another aged product. For packaging defects (cracked bottles, label issues), they're rejected on the bottling line and recycled. After 11 generations, we're good at preventing problems rather than fixing them.

    On storing/drinking tequila:
    Storing tequila in the freezer mutes aromas and flavors — not recommended. Most tequilas are bottled at 40% ABV (80 proof). Tequila doesn't prevent hangovers — any spirit in excess causes one. The real key is quality tequila and drinking responsibly.

    On what people should know about tequila:
    Tequila is a real place — the spirit comes from there and it's where our brand was born. There is a lot of time and care that goes into producing tequila, it's more complicated than people assume. Everything from planting and harvest, to cooking, fermenting and maturation — there are so many variables. Even a blanco, which is unaged, came from a plant that matured at least five years, then had to be cooked, fermented, and distilled. That's a lot of time and care.

    On Especial being "not real tequila" (myth-busting):
    No, that's not true and is a myth. Cuervo Especial is a real tequila — made with 51% Blue Weber agave and 49% other sugars from cane or grain. All fermentable sugars are combined before fermentation and ferment together. We're NOT mixing grain spirits with tequila after the fact — that's a big myth and it's also illegal. Both 100% agave and mixto tequilas are legitimate tequilas recognized by the CRT.

    On jimador wages and farming:
    This is a very serious issue facing our industry. Cuervo is Mexico's largest agricultural company with the largest agave holdings. Jimadores are skilled craftsmen — what they do requires years of training and many are multi-generational. No mechanical solution exists for harvesting agave. We support ~300 full-time jimadores with industry-leading wages, and our agave farmers are our largest employee base with over 4,000 full-time farmers. We also set above-market prices with third-party growers and have long-term contracts to protect the foundational source of the industry.

    On Cuervo's Mexican ownership:
    Cuervo is an 11th-generation family-owned company dating back to 1795. Juan Domingo Beckmann leads the company and is a descendant of Jose Cuervo (who was a real person). Jose Cuervo is the only global spirits company owned by Mexicans.

    On gluten:
    All tequila is naturally gluten-free. Tequila is made from Blue Weber agave, not a grain. Even Cuervo Especial (51% agave, 49% cane or grain sugars) is gluten-free because the distillation process removes gluten proteins.

    On tequila vs mezcal:
    Both are agave spirits but differ in many ways. Tequila can only be made from Blue Weber agave. Mezcal can be made from over 30 different agave species, giving it much more variety. Tequila uses masonry brick ovens or diffusers; mezcal uses underground pits lined with volcanic rocks heated with fire and buried under earth, which creates the smoky flavor. Tequila is mainly from Jalisco (five Mexican states total); mezcal comes from nine states, mostly Oaxaca. Tequila showcases agave character — bright, sometimes peppery, with aged versions getting vanilla and caramel from barrels. Mezcal has smoky, earthy character from pit cooking. The Mexican Tequila NORM does not allow production of another spirit in a tequila distillery. Cuervo also produces mezcals 400 Conejos and Creyente in Oaxaca (separate facilities).

    On reintroducing someone to tequila:
    If they like whiskey, try an añejo or extra añejo — barrel aging gives depth and character similar to whiskey. Tradicional Añejo is finished in Bushmills Irish whiskey barrels, so it tastes different than what people assume tequila will taste like. For blanco lovers, Reserva de la Familia Platino is a must sip.

    On tariffs:
    So far, tequila is exempt from tariffs due to the North American agreement.

    On the master distiller's background:
    Alex started at Cuervo as a strategic planning analyst 30 years ago with a chemical engineering background. He worked between operations and finance, learning every part of the business. That foundation helped when he moved into production and distillation. At home, he has a huge bottle collection showing how designs have changed over time.

    Personal favorites (Master Distiller):
    Blancos — loves the agave-forward flavor without being distracted by barrel aging complexities. For aged tequila: Reserva de la Familia Reposado (three barrel types, different toast/char). Outside tequila: mezcal joven (unaged) for the agave-forward flavor and smoke. "If you send me to the moon, I'm bringing tequila."

    On cocktails:
    Blanco in a margarita is a good representation for strong agave notes. For something more complex, try a reposado or añejo in a tequila Old Fashioned — the oak aging makes it a perfect whiskey substitute.

    =================================

    ABOUT THE BOOK "TEQUILA WARS" by Ted Genoways

    Tequila Wars is a biography of José Cuervo and a chronicle of how tequila became a cultural symbol and economic engine amid Mexico's revolutionary era. The title is both literal and metaphorical — referring to industry rivalries (especially Cuervos vs. Sauzas) and the larger national crises of revolution, banditry, and factional struggles.

    The book opens with Cuervo's dramatic flight on horseback in 1914 after Pancho Villa's forces came to arrest him. He blew tequila into his horse's nostrils — a folk remedy to numb its pain — encapsulating the violence, resourcefulness, and irony of his life.

    José inherited a legacy — his family had cultivated agave since the late 1700s — but his early life wasn't privileged. His father lost holdings to rivals. In 1900, José married Ana González Rubio, a wealthy widow with distillery connections, consolidating control over La Rojeña.

    He modernized production, expanded land holdings, brought electricity and a railroad to Tequila, and showcased his tequila at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair — pivotal in turning tequila from a regional drink into a U.S. export commodity.

    The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) brought violence, extortion, and seized ranches. Cuervo navigated shifting alliances among revolutionary leaders, sometimes courting favor, sometimes fleeing. Villa's forces burned much of the local historical archive, erasing swaths of tequila history.

    Cuervo became a political powerbroker, forming a "union of tequila makers" — a cartel-like alliance to stabilize prices and coordinate strategy. He invested in civic projects and infrastructure for political leverage. During U.S. Prohibition (1920-1933), tequila became a staple of smuggling routes across the border.

    His rival Don Cenobio Sauza's family clashed with the Cuervos over land, markets, and influence — sometimes violently.

    Cuervo died in 1921 at age 51. His funeral went unnoticed by newspapers, leaving him obscure despite the household name on bottles worldwide. Yet his legacy endures: the tequila he industrialized became a global symbol of Mexican culture, and the industry alliances he formed were precursors to modern global spirits markets.
