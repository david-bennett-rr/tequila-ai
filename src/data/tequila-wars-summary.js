    =================================

    Where is tequila made?
    Only five States of Mexico can produce tequila: Jalisco, Guanajuato, Michoacán, Nayarit, and Tamaulipas. Before 1978, tequila was unregulated worldwide. In 1978, leading companies established a globally-recognized Denomination of Origin (D.O.) ensuring the entire production process occurs within the defined region. Other D.O.-protected products include Parmigiano Reggiano and Champagne. Tequila was the first Mexican food or beverage with a D.O.

    What are the rules and classifications of tequila?
    Tequila must be made from blue Weber agave grown in one of the five designated states. The D.O. certifies both the agave and production come from these regions, tying the spirit's identity to its terroir.
    There are two types: 100% Agave Tequila (all sugar from blue Weber agave) and Tequila/Mixtos (minimum 51% agave sugars, the rest from grain, corn, or cane).
    Aging classifications:
    - Blanco (Silver/Plata): unaged or rested up to two months in pipones.
    - Reposado: aged two months to one year.
    - Añejo: aged one to three years.
    - Extra Añejo: aged minimum three years.
    - Cristalino: aged tequila filtered to appear transparent.

    How is tequila made?
    Once blue Weber agave plants reach maturity (up to 12 years) with enough sugar content (Brix), Jimadores harvest the piña by cutting off leaves with a razor-sharp blade. Piñas are cooked to convert carbohydrates into fermentable sugars — traditionally in brick ovens (hornos), or with modern diffusers and autoclaves using steam and pressure, which reduces time, water and energy.
    The cooked agave sugar (aguamiel) is extracted via roller mill or stone tahona wheel, then distilled. Cuervo and 1800 Tequila use both copper pot stills and column stills, and only new American or French oak barrels for aging. Premium expressions are finished in Cognac, Sherry, Single Malt, or Port casks.
    After distillation, blanco rests up to two months, reposado ages 2-12 months, añejo 1-3 years, and extra añejo 3+ years.

    What is agave?
    A succulent native to Mexico with tall, spiny leaves protecting the piña. Often mistaken for a cactus, it's actually closer to the lily family (Liliaceae). It's a century plant — it blooms only once in its lifetime.

    Who is Jose Cuervo and who invented tequila?
    Jose Antonio de Cuervo founded the family business in 1758, obtaining land from the King of Spain and naming it Solar de las Animas. In 1795, his son Jose María Guadalupe de Cuervo received the first official charter to produce tequila commercially, selling the first Vino Mezcal de Tequila de Jose Cuervo.
    Today, Jose Cuervo is the oldest tequila company in the world — an 11th generation, family-owned Mexican company still run by the same family. They were the first to farm agave for tequila production and the first to perform intensive cultivation.

    What is La Rojeña?
    The oldest active tequila distillery in Latin America and the oldest distillery in the Americas, built in 1812 by Cuervo Tequila. Still operating in the town of Tequila, Jalisco.

    What is the NOM?
    The Norma Oficial Mexicana (NOM) is an administrative entity connected to a tequila producer. Jose Cuervo has NOM 1122, encompassing all four distilleries (La Rojeña 1, La Rojeña 2, 1800, Los Camichines) and five brands (Cuervo, Reserva de la Familia, Gran Centenario, 1800, Maestro Dobel, Gran Coramino).

    What is the CRT?
    The Consejo Regulador del Tequila is the official regulatory body overseeing tequila production. It certifies compliance with NOMs, approves every barrel made, and conducts inspections worldwide. It's a non-profit with all distilleries as equal members.

    What is a diffuser?
    A machine using hot water and steam to pressure wash shredded agave fibers, extracting sugary liquid that's then cooked via steam. Diffusers reduce water usage by 50%, energy by 46%, and agave by 20%. They create a different flavor profile and are a more sustainable production method.

    Is tequila made sustainably?
    Cuervo has invested in stillage treatment plants processing about 2 million liters per day. 1800 Tequila reuses, recycles, and repurposes 100% of the agave plant as compost, and supports growers with industry-leading wages and long-term contracts.

    What about additives in tequila?
    Tequila is allowed up to 1% additives in 100% agave tequila. Common additives (used across all spirits, including wine, Rum, Vodka, Cognac, Scotch): caramel extract for color, oak extract for flavor, glycerin for mouthfeel, and sweeteners. These are not unhealthy — they create consistency and standardization.
    Any aged tequila touching a barrel may contain compounds imparted from the wood or previous spirit. "Additive-free" is not an official category — there's no regulatory certification or standardized lab test. Third-party organizations offering "additive-free" labels lack infrastructure for regular batch testing. The moment a spirit touches a barrel, calling it additive-free is misleading.

    What barrels age tequila?
    New American or French oak, or used barrels like American Bourbon. Some expressions are finished in Cognac, Sherry, or Port casks. Cuervo Tradicional Añejo is aged in new American oak then finished in Bushmills Irish single malt whiskey barrels. Reserva de la Familia Extra Añejo is aged in new American and French oak, blended with older reserves from the family cellars.

    ABOUT THE BOOK "TEQUILA WARS" by Ted Genoways

    Tequila Wars is a biography of José Cuervo and a chronicle of how tequila became a cultural symbol and economic engine amid Mexico's revolutionary era. The title is both literal and metaphorical — referring to industry rivalries (especially Cuervos vs. Sauzas) and the larger national crises of revolution, banditry, and factional struggles.

    The book opens with Cuervo's dramatic flight on horseback in 1914 after Pancho Villa's forces came to arrest him. He blew tequila into his horse's nostrils — a folk remedy to numb its pain — encapsulating the violence, resourcefulness, and irony of his life.

    José inherited a legacy — his family had cultivated agave since the late 1700s — but his early life wasn't privileged. His father lost holdings to rivals. In 1900, José married Ana González Rubio, a wealthy widow with distillery connections, consolidating control over La Rojeña.

    He modernized production, expanded land holdings, brought electricity and a railroad to Tequila, and showcased his tequila at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair — pivotal in turning tequila from a regional drink into a U.S. export commodity.

    The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) brought violence, extortion, and seized ranches. Cuervo navigated shifting alliances among revolutionary leaders, sometimes courting favor, sometimes fleeing. Villa's forces burned much of the local historical archive, erasing swaths of tequila history.

    Cuervo became a political powerbroker, forming a "union of tequila makers" — a cartel-like alliance to stabilize prices and coordinate strategy. He invested in civic projects and infrastructure for political leverage. During U.S. Prohibition (1920-1933), tequila became a staple of smuggling routes across the border.

    His rival Don Cenobio Sauza's family clashed with the Cuervos over land, markets, and influence — sometimes violently.

    Cuervo died in 1921 at age 51. His funeral went unnoticed by newspapers, leaving him obscure despite the household name on bottles worldwide. Yet his legacy endures: the tequila he industrialized became a global symbol of Mexican culture, and the industry alliances he formed were precursors to modern global spirits markets.
